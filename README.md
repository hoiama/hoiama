After 6 years of as full stack, I became an experienced entrepreneur with a proven track record of successfully creating startup projects from scratch. Hundreds of users trust the solutions I have developed in Brazil and Portugal. I am driven by challenges, and very resilient, as evidenced by my record time of 28 days to resolve a technical issue. My passion lies in creating solutions that positively impact the lives of many people around the world, and I am always ready to face new challenges and find innovative ways to do so. Let's connect and explore collaboration opportunities!
